For Input pin 1 in my example , subscribe to   /control/leeW_9BDD/pin1

subscribe to   /control/leeW_9BDD/pin1_T for pulse Count
publish to /control/leeW_9BDD/pin1_T to reset counter


/control/leeW_9BDD/pin1 will be freq updated every interval if different from last reading
Input pin 2 in my example is  /control/leeW_9BDD/pin2
Relay 1 topic is /control/leeW_9BDD/pin3 message is 1 for on, 0 for off
